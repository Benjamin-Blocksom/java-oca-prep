# Java OCA Prep

A collection of code snippets that demonstrate essential features of the Java programming language. The set was made as a means of preparing for the Oracle Certified Associate (OCA-808) exam. 

Unless otherwise marked, ask yourself these three essential questions when looking over the code:

* Will it compile?
* Will it throw an error at runtime?
* What is its output when ran?
