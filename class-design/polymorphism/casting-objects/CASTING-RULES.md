When casting variables:

1. Casting an object from a subclass to a superclass doesn't require explicit casting.

2. Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires explicit casting.

3. Compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types.

4. An exception may be thrown if object being cast is not actually an instance of that class...even if it compiles.
