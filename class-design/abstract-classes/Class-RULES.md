# Abstract Class Definition
## RULES

Abstract Classes:

1. May not be directly instantiated.
2. May be defined with zero or more abstract and non-abstract methods.
3. Many not be marked `private` or `final`.
4. When extending another abstract class, it inherits all abstract methods as its own.
5. Must have all methods implemented by the first concrete class to which it bequeths.
