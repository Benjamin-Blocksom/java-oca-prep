# Abstract Class Methods
## RULES

Abstract methods:

1. May only be defined in abstract classes.
2. May not be declared `final` or `private`.
3. Must not provide a body(implementation) in the abstract class for which it is declared.
4. Follow the same implementation rules as for overriding a method. (E.g. name and signature are the same, subclass method visibility must be at least as accessible as parent class method.)
